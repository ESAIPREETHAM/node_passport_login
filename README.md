Node.js Passport Authentication Project

This project demonstrates a login system built with Node.js and Passport.js to handle user authentication. Passport.js, a popular middleware for authentication, allows for easy integration of various authentication methods, such as local strategy (username and password), OAuth (Google, Facebook, etc.), or JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Key Features
1) User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and log in using their credentials.
2) Session Management: Passport.js manages sessions, allowing users to stay logged in while navigating through the site. Sessions are stored with Express-Session and connect-flash is used for displaying flash messages.
3) Local Authentication: Passport Local Strategy is implemented for username and password authentication.
4) OAuth Authentication (Optional): Supports third-party authentication like Google or Facebook for easier login.
5) Password Hashing: Utilizes bcrypt to hash passwords for secure storage.
6) Database Integration: User data is stored in a MongoDB database (can also be configured to work with MySQL or PostgreSQL).

Technologies Used
1) Node.js and Express: Backend server framework
2) Passport.js: Authentication middleware
3) MongoDB and Mongoose: Database and object data modeling for MongoDB
4) bcrypt.js: For hashing passwords before saving them in the database
5) EJS or Handlebars: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages

How It Works----

1) The user registers with their details, which are securely stored in the database.
2) On login, Passport.js checks the credentials and manages the session.
3) Authenticated users can access protected routes, while non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page.
4) Logout functionality is included, which clears the user session and redirects them to the homepage.
5) This project provides a solid foundation for understanding user authentication in Node.js applications and can be easily extended with additional Passport strategies and features.
